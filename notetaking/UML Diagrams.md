uml diagrams are a way to represent the clasese and the relations between them generally for the class diagram we folllow the followinig gconvention which ins:

the classes are represented by boxes, theese boxes contain 2 halfs which are horizontally divided into two ections which are:
top half: attributes represented by + and - , public and private access respectively, 
the botton helf represents the methods of the class which are generally pyblic in natirue though even they can be private.

now the boxes within themselfves are conncected in the follwoing ways, : 
assosiation:
which is of the types: aggregation(loose assosication) this is done in the scenarios where the class referes to other class as an attribute however both the classes can exist independently and can be initiated without the other class, in this case we represent this scenario with a line with end as a open diamond structure

the other type of association is composition which means that one of the class referes to the other class and the other class cannot exist without the existence of the class whcih contains it as an attritues, for eg we can consider a house and room , scenario where the room cannot exist without the hosue so, this is represented with th filled diamond symbol

Dependency:
if a class refers to the other class as a method parameter we can say the class is dependent on it and in the diagram we represent it as a dotted line with an arrow at the end which is the dependency on th cllas;

inheritence: 
this generally represent the is a relation ship eg dog is a animal and this normally mean s that the class inherites and extends the parent class
this is generallyrepresented with a normall arrawo symbol.
