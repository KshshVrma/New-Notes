public key
private key
(signing certificate)

in a short summary there are two types of encryption :

symettric:
here for example there are 2 peple alicxe and bob now they want to share a data that is private and only they 2 can open then they meet once and share the 2 keys with each other , now the data can only be opened by these keys and nothing else, symetric encryption is also like that way.

asymetric:
now suppose if alice wants to share the data with multiple people without it being sharable by any other , ie should be openable only 1-1 way, then what she can do is provide a public key to the other guy for example a padlock , now this padlock can be used in the ffollowing way the other guy can store his data and use the public key(padlock) to secure the data and to send it to alice, now as alice has the private key, only she will be able to unlcok the padlock ie the encrypted data since she has the private key,,.. now similarly if she wants to send some importeatn private data :( ) to the other guy in that scenario she can request for the public key of the other guy ie the padlock and then make use of the padlock to encrypte the data that she wants to send.
this data can only be opened by the guy who is the intended receiver ie the guy who gave the padlock to alice, now when he receives the encrypted data he can simply use the private key that he has to pen the lock.
