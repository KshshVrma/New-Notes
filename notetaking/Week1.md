the code base requires debugging, and therefore the cleanup process would require further steps which include the cleanup process for the toggles: prevention of the readnig of the numbers from the old table and then prevention of the numbeers to be inserted, updated and deleted.
This analysis is pretty much done so that the things that are pendng are cleanup of the comparision logic , and post providing the sign-offs which would require the cards to be migrated and only after that the read toggle to be enabled, which means that the other components would be deployed only post that.

if a project which can scrape data from the websites are to be made that can be made usin the java's library jsoup, using which we can scrape data from websites like amazon, this data can then be fed to a model usnng something like rest template, so that we can do any analysis which needs to be done on top of the data being scraped, now the other point to note is that not all websites allow their data to be scraped and these websites normally have some guidelines on which parts of their websites can be scraped legally which means that some websites like flipkart do not allow their websites to be scraped at all programaticaly however there are workarounds to this by making use of some selenium scripts and mimicing the configuration of the browsers like crome in the scrape reques , this spoofing the website to think that the request comes actually from a legit user. however there must be some rate limits in place meaning that the data which needs to be scraped: needs to be deone responsibly meaning that we do not overload the website with thousands of request over a short span of time. additionally these websites only allow the data which is available in public domain ie without the user logging in , 

when it comes to creatnig projects like url shortners we need to keep some things in mind namely : what kind of algorithm will be used to shorted a url 
how many digits will be present in the new url , 
how are we going to store the url mappings
how are we going to redirect the user to the originial url once the user enters the short url
how is the user going to set the url is it randomly generated or uses any custom provided name bythe user,
if the user provides any custom name in that case what should be the preference do we provide the names which are available now. only or who gets ther prefereance ie if the name is already taken in that case do we deny the creation of the user?
do these url have a time tl live?
do we cache some of these urls in a db like redis which is fast single threaded open sourced and convinient to setup?
how do we determine which are supposed to stay in the cache is it something like least recently accessed moves out or what it is going to be.
how to ensure that all the website names are not easy to guess and just reverse engineer the name based on some generic available algorithms, ie what kind of hashing are going to implement so that the user gets a endpoint that is completely random and we avoid the hash collisions , so that multiple urls don't end up beign mapped to a single endpoint ie shortened url causing collisions.


llm: resttemplate can be used to call llm api's like gemini and thus can be used in a traditional spring boot setup now there have been a lot recent advancements in the filed of ai some of them are:
claude cli , gemini cli which are tools that we setup in the terminal and post running them we can talk to the gemini model offline with the context of the entire folder which is good also we can configure our api keys if we have them in order for them to make use of the paid models directly in our cli.
recently amazon too launched their ai compatible ide tools post integrating which it migth be better to use as compared to even github copilot, now the bloggnig also can be setup using github pages the process being that we download a template and rename the fle to be username.github.io now we can host these blogs with custom themes in to the github pages which can be useful while technical writing or blogging anything in general however we ran into some issue which means that we need to check out the deployment process to understand if there is any issue which needs to be redressed.

there are application which are slow, so the result is that the login page is running very slowly and so we need to ensure that :
the services are scaled properly because the system cannot be autoscaled we need to check if we can scale up the middle ware queues to use some retry logic or increase the number of threads which access the services, we need to ensure that the services are scalled up vertically since horizontal scaling is not possible , if it is first check why are the services not running and all the pods are occupied, if they are then check if the latency is rising only due to any particular metric if no/ pinpointing is not possible and a recent change is causing the latency to rise then try to debug the slowness with each of the possible changes that were made, because if the issue is causing slowness in the login process then that is not a very good user experience.
