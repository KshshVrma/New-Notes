the numberr mismatch is strange the timeline looks like this:

user does the booking for a traveler, ie it is a arranger ,now this happens around 10 , now at 1 the admin changes the password for the traveler and then someone logs in to the user now the user tries to modify and delete the numbers, the numbers are strangly updated in a manner that in the end the data in the old table has a extra number which is not present in the new table, which means either of 2 things there were 2 numbers earlier, the user deleted 1, it showed success however the data only got deleted in the new table, the other scenario is that the user deleted both the existing cards added 2 new however the card only got added to the old table and not the new one, this is unikely because the other parameters present in the old table suggest that the card was existng and might have been modified someway or the other. 
this is a strange occurence , could it be related to the slowness issue, the user was not able to delete the card, logged out and then the card was actually present is it even possible that the delete flow has some issue? should not be the case, the user was not deleted that means that it could be possible that the card was never migrated, however that means that the earlier calls would somehow have that mismatch , but this is a new addition earlier there was a invalid card that was modified to a correct card that moves the number to the 0 index in the new table, and so.. the check if the number lies in the 30 or not, if the number  length is invalid then probably in this invalid card, but that would mean that the card index changed which is not possible.

now we can use github pages for the blogs that would mean that we store the actions and those actions are triggered whenever we push the changes to that particular branch , now that the deployment was stopped there has been no particular new build trigerred even after pushing the changes from remote which means that some further debugging is required to understand about the issue and auto push the blogs to that repo via that deployment pipeline so understanding of github actions is required for this process.

another good game to play is dual n back this is a good test of the working memory and involves the player pressing the a and l keys upon some criterias: 
if the level of the game is 2 in that scenario the user needs to memorise the sound and the block number which flashed 2 turns. this means that the level of the game if 2 would require you to store 2 previous sequence of the sound and the flashed block number this retaining o fthe information is what makes the game fun.
