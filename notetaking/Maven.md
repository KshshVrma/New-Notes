[[Spring boot]]


Maven is a build tool synonymous to gradle it is a popular tool used for packaging java applications, it has different parts in its life cycle right from compiling, test-cases, validating, packaging, deployment, etc phases, . it is very powerful and normally we use the command mvn clean install to start the build

It packages the artifact and places it in the target directory where all the code is packaged and present, Maven uses a pom.xml file which contains all the dependencies in it, it is a xml file with attributes like <dependency>, etc here we define the version of the project which is used to identify the version of the built artifact.
