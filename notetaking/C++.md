c++ is a language that is a superset of the c language.
the main benefits of the language is that it uses pointers and also is an object oriented languege.

the thing that make c++ godd level is the standard template library which contains the implementations of diffferent algorithms and data structures like heaps: priority queue, 
queue, stack , vector, set, map

it is very fast language as it is compiler directly to the machine code by the gcc compiler, also this means that this language is not os independent? ie differnt compilers would be requied fro mac and windows, linux, this is one of the disadvantages of it over java.

another thing is that it does not come with a garbage collector, however it has features like deconstructors which allows it to destroy the objects whenever the runtime ends for them.
 it supports dynamic memory allocation with the keywords: malloc, alloc, realloc.
