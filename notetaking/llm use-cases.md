since we already have the access to the llm's a lot of use-cases can be implemented which include: 
developer: dashboards for documentation.
analysis of logs which would allow the checker to know what are the meaning of the error, it can track a session across the different types of logs to produce analysis about the flow and the errors related to an ord_key which would allow a general steps which can be followed by the devs to debug and find the root cause of the issue.

hotel recommendor not just rule based but also including intelligence for eg if a user who is travelling to us wants a stoppage in uk for a few days then the hotels suggested should be accorindgly not just simple rule based, also a main problem is that in the search results, we do not get to see the top hotels, which might cause the user to find alternatives because in most of the scenarios the user can just book the hotel from a different source.. and so it is not even required to book the different flights and cars together.
