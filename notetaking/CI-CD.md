- GCE (Google Compute Engine): Deploying to a GCE component means the application runs on a Virtual Machine (VM). This is like having a dedicated server in the cloud where you manage the OS, networking, and scaling manually or via scripts. GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine): Deploying to a GKE component means the application runs inside a Kubernetes cluster, which manages containers, scaling, networking, and orchestration automatically — [Updated on 2025-03-18 18:17:33](https://hyp.is/KWpvOAP3EfCcqR9evq4dXw/chatgpt.com/c/67d96a93-9fa4-800e-b235-f70d845ef36a) — Group: #me-only

- Code Push & Trigger A developer pushes code to a repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket). This triggers a Jenkins job (via a webhook or polling mechanism). Jenkins Pipeline Execution Jenkins pulls the latest code and starts the build process. The code is compiled, dependencies are installed, and unit tests run. Jenkins packages the code (e.g., JAR, Docker image). The built artifact is stored in a registry (e.g., Artifactory, GCR, or Nexus). Armada Deployment Jenkins triggers Armada, which manages the deployment process. Armada determines the target environment (GCE or GKE). Deployment manifests or configurations (like Helm charts for GKE) are applied. Deployment to GCE or GKE For GCE: A VM instance is created (or an existing one is updated). The application binary or container is deployed. The VM is configured (firewall rules, startup scripts, load balancer). For GKE: The container image is pulled from the registry. Kubernetes creates a pod running the application. Networking, scaling, and service discovery are handled automatically. — [Updated on 2025-03-18 18:22:40](https://hyp.is/4KHiYgP3EfCPz1e54sYLpA/chatgpt.com/c/67d96a93-9fa4-800e-b235-f70d845ef36a) — Group: #me-only
