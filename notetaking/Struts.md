[[Java]]

Struts is a ui framework that works with java to generate the ui pages accoriding to some templates which are pre-decidec it is a popular framework and requires some configurations, it has action which deteremines tht on a particular evernt which page is forwarded , along with that the action is mapped to the same named bean which is used to map the class to a java file , for eg if we declare the bean type to be prototype in that case it generates the class and runtime and we need to determine which class to generrate 

this makes use of java classes for the logic along with jsp templates which are determined at runtime it requires a lot of configurations and along with that is very verbose, however it give a lot of control considering legacy applications and along with that 
we can make use of them for rendering jsp.
