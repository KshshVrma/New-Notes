copilot can be used for majorly 2 functionalities which are : 

as a code completor: whenever you create a new class/method then the copilot would autocomplete the code the use just has to make use of the accept command and validate the suggestion given by the ai ie the copilot , moreover there are the other main feature which is : 

as a chatbot, mainly having the context of the current file, for specific sugestion we can highlight the line and the copilot would have tall the context fof the ahighlighted part, causing more accureate prediction as an chatbot.

to make copilot we can make use of annotations like :
@project, which gives the chatbot more context over the command and hecnce provide more accuratre and context driven answer output.

in comparision to chatgpt the main benefits of copilot are that we do not have to cont3xt switch , we do not have to copy paste anything and the copilot ahas the cntext of the code automatically, it providies the autocompletion feature and not only that, we can use enterprise level code directly in a llm using copilot becuase of microsofts agreement withthe companies, which ensure the privacy of the data.

however tcopilot still does not have the access to re-prompt itself which means it cannot clearly provide more accurate outputs, by sequencial prompting to itself, 

copilot used by us is of version 4o which is better than 3.5 the frere version but lacks some of the requierd features of chatgpt, and claude which are significantly more accurate than copilot. and secure highter scores in all the benchmarks.

<b>limits</b>
 however the code provided by copilot has the demerit of being to be tested and reevaluated by the developer, and making use of the ai generated code might requrie more debuggin g if all the ideal coding practices are nto followed.

conclusion:
copilot can have great advantages if used judicially , in the sense it can provide the meaning of the current file of the code and in the code place the places at which it is being reference however any code which is generated by ai need s to cbe carefully evaluated and dchecked before it begin shipped to production.
