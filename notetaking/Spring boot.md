spring boot makes java developement easy, 
it makes ap interface creation easier.
we can initialte the spring initializer, and add the required dependencies and specify the build tool we need ie either gradle or maven.

the use of annotations.
specifying and using the beans.

each version of spring boot comes with it's supported version of other core dependencies like web and security , which makes it easier to identify which version work together ie are compatible with each other.

spring boot has an embedded tomcat ie your programs are runnable directly.

why do we need spring boot?
why do we need annotations? if spring too had annotations ie what is the main differnece between spring and spring boot? is it that the xml configuration was required by spring and is not by spring boot?
but if it is required to add some new functionality then do we need a new spring boot version from scratch?
does spring boot change the way we define and use beans? ie through component scans and annotations like controller, service.. etc?
