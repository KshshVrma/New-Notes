is a language designed by dennis richie , it is the standard that most of the compiled languages follow/or are built on top of
it is a low level langueage which allows the user to have more controll specially over memory management and address mangement, 
although it does not support object oriented programming , it does support structs which all the user to define a custom data type, whch is the foundation of the object oriented paradigm.
the language does not have a garbage collector and therefore the coder has to maintain and ensure that all the memory that he has allocated to be freed from the heap otherwise it will block any other process to acceess that memor y leading to memory leakage.

it supports allocation of arrays in contiguous memory block, which allows very fast data lookup times of o1 , not only that the language in general is very fast because it needs to be compiler, and is closer to machine code, however which means that the language is not platform independent meaning that we need different compilers for different operating systems. 

although it is still a subset of c++ still it is used in applications which require better performance. which means that it will be used for apps like games, network calls/ etc where the latency of the application matters.

it allows the user to have file handling, and printing to the console , there are many bit operators which allow the user to do bit manipulation .

the future languages try to follow the pattern of c and in this regard c is indeed the mother of all languages that are present today.
