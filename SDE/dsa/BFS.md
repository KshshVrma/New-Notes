rotten oranges:
here ensure that you are storing the time at which the orange gets rotten for each of the neighbors, the point being if a orange rots at time t, then the neighbor will rot at t+1, so in a q if we have the data stored in a queue, we can traverse the q and for each front 4 directionally we can check and then finally rot an orange.
