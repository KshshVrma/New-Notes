single responsibility:
each class should have single responsibility/ this is so that if multiple stakeholders want to modiffy a functionality then modification of the code does not require testing of everythign again and reduces testing effort required and reduces scope of human error

Open close
code should be open to expansion and close to modification.

liskov substitution principle:
any object should be substitutable with any other implementatoin of the interface??
subclasses should be placable in the places where super classes are called ie child classes should not break behaviour of parent class

interface segregation priciple isp:
do not force implementers to implement some methods that they should not use.

dependency inversion:
high level modules should depend on abstractions and not low level modules directly
