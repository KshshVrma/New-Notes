volatile is an important keyword, especially in programs which use multithreading the core idea is to make writes thread safe which means that whenever we perform any write operation in a thread normally they only update their cache memory and if the variable is being used by multiple threads, then in that case they can update the variables value without knowing the updated value from the other thread this is where the volatile keyword comes to play,the main benefit is that the threadd will now write to it's cache, and the value that is updated will be updated to the main memory before any further write operation can be done over the varialbe.
this does not prevent multiple threads from updating the value at the same time, it's just about updating the main memory after the operations.

this keyword volatile is applied on the top of fields. not on block level

atomic variables ensure that the operations occur in isolation and thus, this ensures that the operations are atomic in nature, these are class objects with their set of methods.

while synchronize is a block level keyword that is blocking in nature
