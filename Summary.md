gemini cli is a useful tool which if used correctly can have the context of the entire application, and be used to summarize entire text if required, 
not just this it is also capable to perform actions, if we compare the main 3 types of ai applicaiton one is rag: which is basically providing context to the llm to provide better solutions to the problem s, we create a vector database out of our documents, and then when the user prompts we fetch n most relevant embeddings from the vector database and then we use this to generate additional context that is used by the llm to provide more accurate answers.

mcp is basically model context protocol: what it does is basically combination of it being a client and there being multiple mcp servers, the client connects with the server not with rest but with sessions and uses it to perform actions, not just provide feedback which means that it can actually do something like book a hotel for you , which is going to be extremely useful in the future.
the way to use these agents can be optimized according to the usage required, you can frme a rough draft of the requiredments and ask them to provide you with the required prompt ask them to be experts in one of the fields, and provide more accurate outputs, the outputs generated by tthese do need to be reviewed , so if you wan the output to be accurate, then you need to ensure that you yourself are reviewing al lthe changes otherwise , they tend to not listen to the feedback , this is especially the case with gemini, which has the tendency to just provide a yes, or yes option lol which means that it is not very good at listening to feedback , so when it comes to automation of task then they do perfrom well especially if the task is tedius but straingforward, eg generting the readme files of a project and pushing the changes to github, however when th task given is not so straight forward they do tend to take more time and struggel however if we get our hands on th paid model like claude they are supposed to be way better thean normal free model and provide better outputs according to the requirement speifications. however currently the model especially ones which are provided by anthropic are expensive they have 3 differnet tiers which include a pay per use model, which i am assuming would be expensive, a limited pro model which asks for 20 dollars a month and another model which asks for 100$per month this provides proper limits , and have sufficient calss, ensuring that any big project can be built. This increases the speed to market which is everything these days, and can become competetive advantage if the benfits are made use of carefully.
however we do need to guide them well and need to behave like their product managers, the more accurate we are in providing queries, the better it is however it does mean that now instead of writing code , we are spending time in optimizing the prompts, it like having a junior dev along with you and has it's tradeoff, the assistant will do the work but wil require a lot of hand holding and it is upto the user to decide if this is worth their time and effort. however i am predicting that over the course of the next 3-4 yhears we would bre having model strong enough that would be able to take decisions on their own and would not require a lot of handholding, our task then would be providing the required context and clear requirements.
